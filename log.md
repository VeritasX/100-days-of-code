# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4th, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Created two methods in a library designed to help in the creation of quizes or tests.

**Thoughts:** I found that sometimes i need to be less clever when writing code and stick to the simplest answer to the solution, I had trouble at first getting one of the methods to work, until i realized i was overthinking the solution and changed to a simpler pattern
