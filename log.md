# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4th, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Created two methods in a library designed to help in the creation of quizes or tests.

**Thoughts:** I found that sometimes i need to be less clever when writing code and stick to the simplest answer to the solution, I had trouble at first getting one of the methods to work, until i realized i was overthinking the solution and changed to a simpler pattern

**Link to work:** [Quiz Creator](https://github.com/VeritasX/Quiz-Creator/commit/e4b7cdad07ae5b65ffd10d199823dcb31a4dc3ac)

### Day 2: January 5th, 2017

**Todays Progress** : Started the search and destroy code challenge on free code camp

**Thoughts:** I realized how much i rely on for loops and although it is good to know and understand how to use a for loop, however there are more functional methods i could use. map, forEach etc.

### Day 3: January  8th, 2017

**Todays Progress** : I created several functions for my Quiz-Creator library.

**Thoughts:** I found myself thinking about how the methods would be used so i included checking on some of the arguments. for example, I have a method that needs argument to be an array, so I started to research on MDN what methods I could use and I decided on Array.isArray(Item). It was clean, simple and straight to the point. I also discovered that when checking to see if something is a number typof x = 'number' reads better in my oppinion than Number.isNan(X). It seemed like the code was more understandable and you didnt have to know the intricacies of Number.isNan(X).
